## 🚀 What's New: Major Intelligence Upgrade

This beta introduces **AI-native workflow understanding** - a fundamental shift from simple command recording to intelligent design memory.

### ✨ New Features

#### **50+ Command Support** (Expanded from 25)
- **Primitives**: Box, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Plane, Torus
- **Curves**: Line, Circle, Rectangle, Arc, Polyline, Ellipse, Polygon
- **Surfaces**: Extrude, Loft, Revolve, Sweep1, Sweep2, NetworkSrf
- **Transformations**: Move, Copy, Rotate, Scale, Mirror, Array operations
- **Boolean Operations**: Union, Difference, Intersection, Split
- **Editing**: Fillet, Chamfer, Trim, Split, Join, Offset, Rebuild
- **Analysis**: Distance, Angle, Area, Volume, Curvature Analysis

#### **Semantic Intelligence**
- **Rich Data Capture**: Dimensions, positions, creation methods, design intent
- **Command Relationships**: Understands dependencies between operations
- **Workflow Analysis**: Tracks creation → modification → finishing stages
- **Transformation Tracking**: Precise movement vectors, scale factors, rotation data

#### **Enhanced AI Prompts**
- *"Keep the array pattern but make the base geometry organic"*
- *"Scale 150% while preserving all proportional relationships"*
- *"Optimize for 3D printing while maintaining design intent"*

## 🧪 Beta Testing Guidelines

### **What to Test**
1. **Command Capture**: Try various modeling workflows with the 50+ supported commands
2. **AI Transformations**: Test different types of prompts (geometric, functional, aesthetic)
3. **Complex Workflows**: Boolean operations, arrays, surface operations
4. **Edge Cases**: Unusual command sequences, large models, complex dependencies

### **What to Expect**
- ✅ **New intelligence features** work but may have rough edges
- ⚠️ **Some bugs** in command capture or AI generation
- ⚠️ **Performance issues** with very complex models
- ⚠️ **UI quirks** or error messages that aren't user-friendly
- ✅ **Frequent updates** as bugs are fixed

### **Known Issues** (Being Worked On)
- Command capture may miss some edge cases
- AI generation occasionally produces invalid scripts
- UI feedback could be more informative
- Performance optimization needed for large workflows
- Error handling improvements in progress
