# Contextform - AI Design Memory Plugin for Rhino

## Overview

Contextform captures your modeling process as "memory" and uses AI to regenerate designs based on any criteria. Transform your designs by simply describing what you want: "make this organic", "optimize for 3D printing", "convert to sheet metal", etc.

## Features

- **Automatic Capture**: Records your modeling commands in the background
- **AI Generation**: Uses Claude AI to generate new geometry based on your design memory
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-use panel with start/stop capture and prompt input  
- **Script Execution**: Automatically replaces original geometry with AI-generated versions

## Installation

1. Download the .yak file from Food4Rhino
2. Install using Rhino's Package Manager or drag-and-drop into Rhino
3. Restart Rhino
4. Find the Contextform panel in Panels menu

## Usage

1. **Start Capture**: Click "Start Capture" and begin modeling
2. **Create Geometry**: Use any Rhino commands (Box, Sphere, Move, etc.)
3. **Stop Capture**: Click "Stop Capture" when finished
4. **AI Transform**: Enter a prompt like "make this organic" and click "Generate with AI"
5. **View Result**: Your original geometry will be replaced with the AI-generated version

## Example Prompts

- "make this organic"
- "optimize for 3D printing"
- "add ventilation patterns"
- "make it parametric"
- "apply art deco style"

## Requirements

- Rhino 8
- Internet connection for AI generation
