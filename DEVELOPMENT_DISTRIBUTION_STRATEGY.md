# 🚧 Development Distribution Strategy

## Current Status: Active Development with Continuous Updates

This plugin is under **active development** with frequent updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements. Here's our multi-channel distribution approach:

## 🔄 Development-Friendly Distribution

### 1. **GitHub Releases** (Primary Development Channel)
- **Frequent releases** as features are added and bugs fixed
- **Pre-release tags** for testing new features
- **Issue tracking** directly linked to releases
- **Community feedback** drives development priorities

### 2. **Food4Rhino** (Stable Milestone Releases)
- Submit **major versions** only (v1.0, v2.0, etc.)
- **Stable builds** that have been tested by community
- **Slower update cycle** suitable for production users
- **Official plugin store** presence for discoverability

### 3. **Direct Distribution** (Development Builds)
- **Latest builds** available immediately
- **Experimental features** for power users
- **Quick bug fixes** without release overhead
- **Direct feedback loop** with developers

## 🐛 Bug Management Strategy

### Known Issues Tracking
- **GitHub Issues** for bug reports and feature requests
- **Labels** for priority, type, and status
- **Milestones** for planned releases
- **Community contributions** welcome

### Release Cycle
```
Development → Testing → Pre-release → Stable Release
     ↓           ↓          ↓            ↓
