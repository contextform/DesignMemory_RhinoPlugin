# 🧪 [BETA TESTING] Contextform v1.1.0 - AI Design Memory with Intelligence Upgrade

**Looking for beta testers to help improve an AI plugin that understands Rhino workflows!**

## 🚧 Beta Status - Your Help Needed

This is a **development release** with some known bugs that I'm actively fixing. I need community feedback to make it stable before the official release.

**Perfect for:** Power users who want to test cutting-edge features and don't mind occasional issues.

## 📥 Download Beta

**🧪 [GitHub Release v1.1.0-beta](https://github.com/contextform/DesignMemory_RhinoPlugin/releases/tag/v1.1.0-beta)**
- Download `.yak` file → Rhino → `PackageManager` → Install from File
- Restart Rhino → Panels → Contextform

## 🧠 What's New: Intelligence Revolution

This isn't just a command recorder anymore - it **understands** your modeling workflow:

### **50+ Command Support** (Expanded from 25)
Now captures comprehensive Rhino workflows:
- **All major primitives, curves, surfaces**
- **Transformations with precise data** (move vectors, scale factors)
- **Boolean operations with relationship tracking**
- **Editing operations** (fillet, chamfer, trim, etc.)
- **Analysis commands**

### **Semantic Intelligence**
- **Knows dimensions and positions** - not just command names
- **Tracks command relationships** - understands what depends on what
- **Workflow stages** - creation → modification → finishing
- **Design intent inference** - understands the *why* behind your modeling

### **Smart AI Prompts**
Try these workflow-aware transformations:
- *"Keep the array pattern but make the base geometry organic"*
- *"Scale everything 150% while preserving proportional relationships"*
- *"Change the boolean operation but keep the same base shapes"*
- *"Optimize for 3D printing while maintaining the design philosophy"*

## 🎯 Example: Intelligence in Action

**Your Workflow:**
1. Create Box (10x10x5)
2. Create Sphere (radius 3) 
3. Boolean Union
4. Linear Array (5 copies, spacing 15)

**AI Understands:**
- Box and sphere dimensions/positions
- Boolean dependency relationship  
- Array pattern and spacing
- Overall design intent

**Smart Prompt:** *"make the base geometry organic but keep the same array"*

**Result:** Organic blob shape → arrayed 5 times with 15-unit spacing
*(Maintains workflow structure while transforming geometry)*

## 🧪 Beta Testing - What I Need

### **Please Test:**
- **Your typical workflows** - model something you normally do
- **Various command combinations** - especially boolean ops, arrays, surfaces
- **Different AI prompts** - geometric, functional, aesthetic transformations
- **Edge cases** - complex models, unusual command sequences

### **Report If You Find:**
- Commands not being captured correctly
- AI generating invalid/broken scripts
- Performance issues with your models
- UI confusion or unclear error messages
- Any crashes or major bugs

### **How to Report:**
- **GitHub Issues**: [Bug Report Template](https://github.com/contextform/DesignMemory_RhinoPlugin/issues)
- **Include:** Steps to reproduce, commands used, error messages
- **This thread:** Quick questions or general feedback

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Working On)

- Command capture edge cases need fixing
- AI generation occasionally produces invalid scripts  
- Performance optimization needed for complex workflows
- Error messages could be more helpful
- UI feedback improvements in progress

## 🔄 Beta Cycle

- **Frequent updates** as bugs are fixed (v1.1.0-beta.1, beta.2, etc.)
- **Community-driven priorities** - your feedback shapes development
- **Quick turnaround** on critical issues
- **Stable release** when community testing shows it's ready

## 🎯 Why Beta Test?

- **Shape the future** of AI-CAD integration
- **Get advanced features early** before official release
- **Direct influence** on plugin development
- **Free during beta** - full AI capabilities at no cost

## 🤔 Questions for Beta Testers

1. **What workflows do you model most often?** I'll suggest AI prompts that would work great
2. **What commands are missing** that you use regularly?
3. **What types of transformations** would be most useful for your work?

## 🚀 The Vision

By the time this reaches stable release, the goal is:
- **Understand your entire modeling process** - not just individual commands
- **Generate contextually appropriate transformations** - respect your design intent
- **Support complex workflows** - boolean ops, arrays, surfaces, everything
- **Natural language interface** - describe what you want, get intelligent results

**Who's interested in testing?** Drop a comment with the types of modeling you do and I'll suggest some AI prompts to try! 

**Already tested?** Share your results - what worked, what didn't, what was surprising!

This could be a game-changer for CAD workflows, but I need your help to make it solid. Thanks for considering beta testing! 🙏
