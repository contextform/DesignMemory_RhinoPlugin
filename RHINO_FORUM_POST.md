# ðŸ¤– Contextform v1.1.0 - AI Design Memory with Workflow Intelligence

**Transform your Rhino designs with natural language using intelligent workflow understanding!**

## ðŸ“¥ Download Now (Free Beta)

**GitHub Release**: [Download v1.1.0](https://github.com/contextform/DesignMemory_RhinoPlugin/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
- `.yak` file for easy installation via PackageManager
- `.rhp` file for manual installation
- Full documentation and installation guide

## ðŸ§  What Makes This Different

Unlike macro recorders or simple command capture tools, Contextform **understands** your modeling process:

- **Semantic Capture**: Records dimensions, positions, relationships - not just command names
- **Workflow Intelligence**: Understands dependencies between commands
- **Design Intent**: AI infers the *why* behind your modeling choices
- **Context-Aware Transformation**: Respects your original design structure

## ðŸš€ New in v1.1.0: Major Intelligence Upgrade

### **50+ Command Support**
Comprehensive coverage across all major Rhino categories:
- Primitives, Curves, Surfaces, Transformations
- Boolean Operations, Editing, Analysis
- Arrays, Lofts, Sweeps, Fillets, and more

### **Smart Workflow Understanding**
```
Example: Box â†’ Sphere â†’ Boolean Union â†’ Array
The AI knows:
- Boolean relationship between box and sphere
- Array depends on the boolean result  
- Transformations should preserve these relationships
```

### **Enhanced AI Prompts**
- *"Make this organic but keep the array pattern"*
- *"Optimize for 3D printing while maintaining design intent"*
- *"Scale 150% but preserve all proportional relationships"*

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. **Start Capture** - Records your modeling session with intelligent analysis
2. **Model Normally** - Use any supported Rhino commands
3. **Stop Capture** - Saves rich semantic data and workflow relationships
4. **Transform with AI** - Natural language prompt transforms your design
5. **Smart Results** - AI respects your original modeling structure

## ðŸŽ¯ Real Example

**Modeling Session:**
```
1. Create Box (10x10x5)
2. Create Sphere (radius 3) at box center
3. Boolean Union
4. Linear Array (5 copies, spacing 15)
```

**AI Understands:**
- Box and sphere dimensions and positions
- Boolean dependency relationship
- Array pattern and spacing
- Overall design intent

**Transform Prompt:** *"make the base geometry organic but keep the same array"*

**Result:** Organic blob shape arrayed 5 times with 15-unit spacing - maintains the workflow structure!

## ðŸ›  Technical Features

- **Native Rhino 8 Integration** - Dockable panel, background capture
- **Rich Memory Model** - JSON serialization with dependency analysis  
- **Performance Optimized** - Minimal impact on modeling workflow
- **Cloud AI** - Uses Anthropic Claude for intelligent script generation
