# Contextform - AI Design Memory Plugin

## Transform Your Designs with Natural Language

Contextform captures your Rhino modeling process as intelligent "design memory" and uses AI to transform your designs based on simple text prompts. Just model normally, then tell the AI what you want: "make this organic", "optimize for 3D printing", "add art deco patterns" - and watch your geometry transform!

## üß† What Makes It Smart

Unlike simple macro recorders, Contextform **understands** your modeling process:

- **50+ Supported Commands** - Captures all major Rhino operations with semantic understanding  
- **Workflow Intelligence** - Understands dependencies between commands and design intent
- **Semantic Capture** - Records not just what you did, but dimensions, positions, and relationships
- **Transformation Tracking** - Precise capture of movements, scaling, and rotations

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Intelligent Capture
- Automatically records your modeling commands in the background
- Captures semantic data: dimensions, positions, design intent
- Tracks command relationships and dependencies
- Understands workflow patterns and modeling sequences

### AI-Powered Transformation  
- Natural language prompts: "make this organic", "optimize for manufacturing"
- Context-aware script generation that respects your original design intent
- Maintains geometric relationships during transformations
- Uses enhanced prompts with rich semantic data

### Seamless Integration
- Native Rhino 8 plugin with dockable panel
- Works with your existing modeling workflow
- Automatic geometry replacement with AI-generated versions
- Comprehensive command support across all categories

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Start Capture** - Click once to begin recording your modeling session
2. **Model Normally** - Use any supported Rhino commands (Box, Extrude, Array, Boolean, etc.)
3. **Stop Capture** - Click to finish recording your design memory
4. **Transform with AI** - Enter a text prompt describing your desired transformation
5. **See Results** - Your original geometry is replaced with the AI-generated version

## üìã Comprehensive Command Support

**Primitives**: Box, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Plane, Torus  
**Curves**: Line, Circle, Rectangle, Arc, Polyline, Ellipse, Polygon  
**Surfaces**: Extrude, Loft, Revolve, Sweep1, Sweep2, NetworkSrf  
**Transformations**: Move, Copy, Rotate, Scale, Mirror, Array operations  
**Boolean Operations**: Union, Difference, Intersection, Split  
**Editing**: Fillet, Chamfer, Trim, Split, Join, Offset, Rebuild  
**Analysis**: Distance, Angle, Area, Volume, Curvature Analysis  

## üí° Example Transformations

### Style & Aesthetics
- "make this organic and flowing"
- "apply art deco geometric patterns" 
- "create a biomimetic surface structure"
- "add parametric subdivision patterns"

### Manufacturing & Function
- "optimize for 3D printing with supports"
- "prepare for CNC machining"
- "add ventilation patterns for airflow"
- "create sheet metal bend allowances"

### Parametric Variations
- "increase overall scale by 150%"
- "make the curves more angular"
- "add recursive geometric patterns"
- "create lattice infill structure"

## üõ† Requirements

- **Rhino 8** (Windows)
- **Internet connection** for AI generation
- **.NET Framework 4.8** (included with Rhino 8)

## üß™ Free Beta

This is a free beta version with full AI capabilities provided at no cost. We're actively gathering feedback to improve the plugin's intelligence and expand its capabilities.

## üèó Technical Innovation

Contextform represents a new approach to CAD automation - instead of rigid scripting, it uses AI-native design memory that understands modeling intent and can adapt transformations contextually. The plugin captures rich semantic data including:

- Command relationships and dependencies
- Geometric transformation data (movement vectors, scale factors)
- Workflow patterns (creation sequences, modification chains) 
- Design intent inference based on command context

This enables AI generation that respects your original design structure while implementing the requested transformations.
